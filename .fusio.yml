# The deploy configuration contains all resources of the app in simple configuration files which can be deployed through
# the following command:
# > php bin/fusio deploy
# Through this you can store your complete app configuration in simple configuration files under GIT and reproduce your
# Fusio configuration on deployment. The deployment then calls also the internal API to create these resources. To see
# an example howto use the deployment please take a look at our repository: https://github.com/apioo/fusio-sample-cms
